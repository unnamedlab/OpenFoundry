# `tools/ceph-lint`

Static contract lint for the Rook-Ceph manifests under
`infra/k8s/platform/manifests/rook/` (`cluster.yaml`, `objectstore.yaml`).

## Why

Ceph is the sumidero of every persistent workload in OpenFoundry: Iceberg
parquet, Kafka tiered storage, Postgres WAL, model artefacts, dataset
buckets. Its quorum (mon) and rack/AZ-awareness (CRUSH `failureDomain`)
are *invisible by default* — when they regress, nothing breaks until the
day a zone or rack actually goes down, and at that point the whole
lakehouse goes with it.

This linter encodes the contract once so a regression cannot reach `main`:

- **Mon quorum**: `mon.count` is odd and `>= 3`; `allowMultiplePerNode`
  is `false`.
- **Mgr HA**: `mgr.count >= 2`; `allowMultiplePerNode` is `false`.
- **Mon/Mgr placement**: `placement.mon.topologySpreadConstraints` and
  `placement.mgr.topologySpreadConstraints` declare an AZ-level (or
  rack-level) `topologyKey` so the scheduler cannot land every mon (or
  every mgr) in the same zone. A node-level key
  (`kubernetes.io/hostname`) on its own does **not** satisfy the contract.
- **Disruption management**: `disruptionManagement.managePodBudgets:
  true` so a `kubectl drain` cannot evict more mons or OSDs than the
  quorum / CRUSH map tolerates.
- **Pool failure domain**: every `CephBlockPool` and `CephObjectStore`
  pool uses `failureDomain` ∈ {`zone`, `rack`, `region`, `datacenter`,
  `room`}. `host` is rejected by default; documented legacy resources
  kept for backwards-compatibility live in an explicit allowlist
  (`LEGACY_HOST_FAILURE_DOMAIN_ALLOWLIST`) inside the script and are
  cross-referenced in `infra/k8s/platform/manifests/rook/README.md`.

The `CephFilesystem` data/metadata pools are checked too if any are added
in the future, even though none is shipped today.

## Run locally

```
pip install pyyaml
python3 tools/ceph-lint/check_topology.py
```

Or via `just`:

```
just ceph-topology-lint
```

The script exits 0 on success and 1 on any contract violation, printing
each violated invariant.

## CI

Runs on every push and pull request that touches `infra/k8s/platform/manifests/rook/**` or
this tool — see `.github/workflows/ceph-lint.yml`.
