## 🎯 How We Prioritize

1. **User value first** — Does this unlock a workflow that wasn't possible before?
2. **Foundation before features** — Auth, data layer, and ontology must be solid before ML/AI.
3. **Horizontal before vertical** — Basic versions of many features > perfect version of one.
4. **Community signal** — GitHub issues with 👍 reactions influence priority.
5. **Contributor interest** — If someone wants to build it, we help them ship it.
