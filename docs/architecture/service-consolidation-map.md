# Service consolidation map — 99 service directories → 36 ownership boundaries

> Companion to [ADR-0030](adr/ADR-0030-service-consolidation-30-targets.md)
> and [ADR-0042](adr/ADR-0042-service-consolidation-map-reconciliation.md)
> (reconciliation of 4 directories the original map did not enumerate).
> Tracks per-service status of the consolidation work declared in
> Stream S8.1 of the Cassandra/Foundry parity migration plan.
>
> Audit date: 2026-05-05 (S8 sql/BI consolidation). The live repository
> has **90 directories** under `services/` (`ls services/ | wc -l`). S8
> is now measured as ownership/deployment consolidation, not as physical
> reduction of the source tree to 30 directories. The three retired
> stubs `health-check-service`, `tool-registry-service` and
> `widget-registry-service` are documented below the current map and
> must not appear in Helm or compose runtime surfaces. The model-plane
> consolidation completed on 2026-05-05 retired `ml-experiments-service`,
> `model-adapter-service` and `model-lifecycle-service` into
> `model-catalog-service`. The same day's SQL/BI consolidation retired
> `sql-warehousing-service`, `tabular-analysis-service` and
> `analytical-logic-service` into `sql-bi-gateway-service`; the
> analytical-expressions surface collapsed further into the new
> internal `libs/analytical-logic` crate (no duplicated HTTP routes).
>
> ADR-0030's original "95 dirs → 33 ownership boundaries + 3 sinks" framing
> is amended by ADR-0042 to "99 dirs → 36 ownership boundaries + 3 sinks +
> 1 non-Rust runtime image"; the four newly-enumerated directories
> (`iceberg-catalog-service`, `media-transform-runtime-service`,
> `pipeline-runner`, `reindex-coordinator-service`) were already accepted
> by ADR-0021, ADR-0036, ADR-0039 and ADR-0041 — only the map was stale.

## Status legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| `keep` | Stays as a top-level ownership boundary in the current target. |
| `merge → X` | Pending: routes/storage/types still owned by the legacy crate; will be merged into `X`. |
| `merged → X` | Done: legacy crate removed; `X` is the runtime owner. |
| `delete` | Service domain is fully owned elsewhere; legacy crate scheduled for deletion. |
| `sink` | Kafka consumer / relay; counted separately from ownership boundaries. |
| `image` | Non-Rust container image directory (build artifact, not a workspace member); counted separately from ownership boundaries. |

Kept as its own ownership boundary so the metadata plane (`media-sets-service`) and the compute plane scale and ship independently. |
| `ml-experiments-service` | `model-catalog-service` | merged → `model-catalog-service` | S8: directory removed; experiments handler now re-exported by `model-catalog-service` from `libs/ml-kernel`. |

| `reindex-coordinator-service` | `reindex-coordinator-service` | keep | Rust replacement (FASE 4 / Tarea 4.2) for the Go `workers-go/reindex` Temporal worker (ADR-0021). Owns the resume cursor in `pg-runtime-config.reindex_jobs`, drives Cassandra page-by-page scans via `cassandra-kernel`, and fans batches out to `services/ontology-indexer` over `ontology.reindex.v1`. Distinct ownership boundary (Postgres state + Temporal-replacement semantics) from the downstream `ontology-indexer` sink. |

## Retired service directories

These services were present in older S8 planning artifacts but are no longer
directories under `services/` and must not be rendered by Helm or compose:

| Retired service | Runtime owner | Closure |
| --------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| `health-check-service` | `telemetry-governance-service` | S8.1.a / S8.6.c |
| `tool-registry-service` | `agent-runtime-service` | S8.1.b |
| `widget-registry-service` | `application-composition-service` | S8.1.b / S8.6.b |

## Summary by status

| Status | Count |
| ------ | ----- |
| keep / ownership boundary | 36 |
| merge → X (pending) | 53 |
| merged → X (completed) | 3 |
| delete scheduled for active legacy dirs | 3 |
| sink | 3 |
| image (non-Rust runtime image) | 1 |
| **Total current service directories** | **96** |
| **Retired service directories tracked for references** | **6** |
| **Current target metric** | **36 ownership boundaries + 3 sinks + 1 non-Rust runtime image across 5 Helm releases** |

## Execution sequence

Each merge is its own PR. The recommended ordering minimises rebase
churn:

1. **Sinks-and-leaves first** — services with zero downstream
   consumers drain to their parents. The three S8.1 retired stubs listed
   above have already drained and must stay absent from runtime manifests.
2. **Same-keyspace clusters** next — merges where source and target
   already share a Cassandra keyspace or Postgres schema (no data
   migration), e.g. ontology-actions absorbing
   ontology-functions/funnel/security.
3. **Cross-store merges** last — those that require schema work
   (e.g. consolidating audit-compliance with sds + retention +
   lineage-deletion all in `pg-policy`).
4. **Legacy macroservices** stay last (R-prompts in
   [`prompts-migracion-hasta-85-microservicios.md`](../../prompts-migracion-hasta-85-microservicios.md)).
