## Runtime Code

`services/` contains 50 service directories under a single Go module rooted at `github.com/openfoundry/openfoundry-go`. The textual boilerplate every new service starts from lives at `docs/templates/service-skeleton/` (its `.go` files carry `//go:build ignore` so the toolchain skips them in place). Grouping below follows the Helm releases under `infra/helm/apps/` (`of-platform`, `of-data-engine`, `of-ontology`, `of-ml-aip`, `of-apps-ops`, `of-web`).

### Platform (auth, gateway, tenancy)

| Path | What Lives There |
| --- | --- |
| `services/edge-gateway-service` | edge routing, JWT validation, rate limiting, request fan-out |
| `services/identity-federation-service` | login, MFA, WebAuthn, OIDC/SAML/OAuth flows, service accounts, sessions, SCIM, JWKS rotation |
| `services/authorization-policy-service` | Cedar-backed ABAC/RBAC decision point, policy CRUD, restricted views |
| `services/tenancy-organizations-service` | tenant resolution, organizations, workspace enrollments, sharing boundaries |
| `services/audit-compliance-service` | audit ledger, retention policies, lineage deletion subsystem |
| `services/audit-sink` | Kafka → Iceberg consumer for `audit.events.v1` |
| `services/cipher-service` | real same-named backend for the gateway `Cipher` alias (`cipher_service_url`); `DefaultUpstreams()` routes `/api/v1/auth/cipher/*` here by default |
| `services/network-boundary-service` | network-boundary placeholder/API skeleton; the directory exists, but `DefaultUpstreams().NetworkBoundary` still resolves the `network_boundary_service_url` alias to `authorization-policy-service` unless configuration overrides it (the checked-in gateway `config.yaml` does override to port `50119`) |

### Data engine (ingestion, datasets, lineage, pipelines, BI)

| Path | What Lives There |
| --- | --- |
| `services/connector-management-service` | data sources, REST webhooks, connector runtime |
| `services/action-log-sink` | Kafka → Iceberg consumer for ontology action audit events |
| `services/ingestion-replication-service` | batch + streaming ingestion (Kafka via `libs/event-bus-data`), branching, replication |

| `services/iceberg-catalog-service` | Iceberg REST catalog (Foundry-flavor) over Lakekeeper |
| `services/iceberg-object-indexer` | Iceberg scan worker that indexes rows into `object-database-service` |

| `services/knowledge-index-service` | real same-named backend for `knowledge_index_service_url`; current gateway owner for `/api/v1/ai/knowledge-bases*` CRUD, document, and search routes |
| `services/ai-evaluation-service` | LLM evaluation + guardrail benchmarking |
| `services/ai-sink` | Kafka → Iceberg consumer for `ai.events.v1` |

### Apps & ops

| Path | What Lives There |
| --- | --- |
| `services/application-composition-service` | Workshop app composition, pages, widgets, publish runtime |
| `services/notebook-runtime-service` | notebooks: CRUD, cells, sessions, kernels, export |

> Older docs referenced services that **do not exist** as binaries in this monorepo (`ontology-service`, `auth-service`, `audit-service`, `data-connector`, `pipeline-service`, `dataset-service`, `ai-service`, `ml-service`, `marketplace-service`, `document-reporting-service`, `fusion-service`, `streaming-service`, `nexus-service`, `dataset-quality-service`, `lineage-deletion-service`, `event-streaming-service`, `data-asset-catalog-service`). Their capabilities are consolidated in the services above. A gateway key named `*_service_url` is not a guarantee that `services/<name>/` exists or is the code default target; verify aliases against `services/edge-gateway-service/internal/config/config.go` and `docs/architecture/services-and-ports.md`. `cipher-service`, `knowledge-index-service`, `global-branch-service`, and `report-service` do exist now and are the current same-named default backends for their gateway aliases.
