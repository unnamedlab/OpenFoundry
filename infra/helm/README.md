# `infra/helm/` — single Helm tree

Everything OpenFoundry runs on Kubernetes is defined here, orchestrated
by **one** [`helmfile.yaml.gotmpl`](helmfile.yaml.gotmpl). No Flux, no
ArgoCD, no separate "platform" vs "apps" Helmfiles.

## Tree

## What lives where, in one sentence

* `apps/`       — code we wrote.
* `operators/`  — operators someone else wrote (Strimzi, CNPG, …).
* `infra/`      — clusters/CRs we tell those operators to provision.
* `_shared/`    — library helpers consumed by `apps/`.
* `profiles/`   — environment-wide values (dev/staging/prod/postures).

## Install / upgrade

```sh
cd infra/helm

# render only — no cluster contact
helmfile -e dev template

# diff against current cluster state
helmfile -e dev diff

# apply
helmfile -e dev apply

# tear down
helmfile -e dev destroy
```

Environments: `dev`, `staging`, `prod`. Postures (layered on top of
`prod`): `airgap`, `multicloud`, `sovereign-eu`, `apollo`.

## Install order

The helmfile groups releases in three layers and uses `needs:` to enforce
order between them:

1. **Operators** — cert-manager, cnpg, k8ssandra-operator,
   strimzi-operator, rook-ceph-operator, flink-operator.
2. **Infrastructure clusters / CRs** — postgres-clusters,
   cassandra-cluster, kafka-cluster, ceph-cluster, lakekeeper,
   debezium, flink-jobs, vespa, trino, spark-operator, spark-jobs, mimir,
   observability, local-registry.
3. **Application** — of-platform first; then of-data-engine, of-ontology,
   of-ml-aip, of-apps-ops in parallel; of-web last.

Within a layer, releases install concurrently. Across layers, helmfile
waits for every dependency to be `deployed` (per `needs:`).

## Profile gates (dev-friendly defaults)

The dev profile keeps heavy releases off:

| Release | dev | staging | prod |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Vespa, Trino, Spark, Mimir, Rook-Ceph, Flink | off | partial | on |
| Cassandra, Kafka, Postgres, Lakekeeper, Debezium | on | on | on |
| local-registry | on | off | off |

## Adding a new release

* New OpenFoundry service → add to `apps/<release>/values.yaml` and the
  service catalogue (no new chart needed; the 5 release-aligned charts
  already template every service).
* New third-party operator → create `operators/<name>/Chart.yaml` with
  the upstream dependency, and add a release entry to the helmfile.
* New third-party cluster CR → create `infra/<name>/templates/...yaml`
  with the CR, plus `Chart.yaml` and `values.yaml`. Reference the
  operator it depends on via `needs:` in the helmfile.

## What got removed in this refactor

* `infra/k8s/platform/manifests/` — duplicate of root-level dirs.
* `infra/k8s/helm/open-foundry/` — legacy umbrella chart (ADR-0031).
* `infra/k8s/clickhouse/` — ClickHouse stack (no longer used).
* Flux v2 `HelmRelease` for Temporal — first replaced by an in-tree
  wrapper chart, then retired entirely by FASE 9 / Tarea 9.1 of the
  Foundry-pattern migration (ADR-0027). Pipelines run via
  SparkApplication CRs; everything else uses Postgres state machines
  + outbox + Kafka. The companion Cassandra keyspace cleanup
  (`temporal_persistence`, `temporal_visibility`) is documented in
  [`infra/runbooks/temporal.md`](../runbooks/temporal.md).
* The split between `platform/helmfile.yaml.gotmpl` and
  `helm/helmfile.yaml.gotmpl` — collapsed into a single file.
