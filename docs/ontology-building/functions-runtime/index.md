# Functions by runtime

Functions are likely to evolve into a multi-runtime capability in OpenFoundry.

## Current runtime signals

The repo already suggests several function execution modes:

- Rust-native control-plane logic
- Node-oriented package simulation and validation via `node_runtime_command`
- Python-enabled semantics through `pyo3` in `ontology-service`
- SDK-backed external consumption paths

## Why this matters

Separating function capability by runtime helps document:

- authoring ergonomics
- execution limits
- packaging requirements
- security and permission models
