# OpenFoundry Architecture

The canonical technical documentation lives in [`docs/`](docs/). This
file is a short top-level overview; for runtime detail follow the
links below.

## Stack at a glance

- **Backend:** Go (single module rooted at `github.com/openfoundry/openfoundry-go`)
  with 50 service directories under [`services/`](services/) and 36
  shared packages under [`libs/`](libs/). Treat those directories as the
  source of truth for inventory counts and re-check with `find services`
  / `find libs` before editing count-sensitive docs. New services are bootstrapped
  from the textual skeleton in
  [`docs/templates/service-skeleton/`](docs/templates/service-skeleton/).
- **Frontend:** React 19 + Vite + TypeScript in [`apps/web/`](apps/web/).
- **Contracts:** Protobuf in [`proto/`](proto/), Go code generated to
  [`libs/proto-gen/`](libs/proto-gen/) via `buf` (run `make gen`).
- **SDKs:** TypeScript / Python / Java in [`sdks/`](sdks/), generated
  from the proto + OpenAPI surface.
- **Storage:** Postgres (CNPG + PgBouncer), Cassandra, Kafka (Strimzi
  + MM2), Iceberg (Lakekeeper), Vespa (search + RAG), Temporal
  (workflow), Ceph S3.
- **Infra:** Helm + ArgoCD + Terraform under [`infra/`](infra/).

## Service grouping

Services are grouped into Helm releases ("ownership boundaries") rather
than physically merged binaries. The current grouping:

   * = Kafka sinks (counted separately from ownership boundaries).
```

The grouping is consolidation by ownership and Helm release, **not** a
claim that the source tree has been physically merged. The ownership
boundaries are defined in
[`docs/architecture/adr/ADR-0030-service-consolidation-30-targets.md`](docs/architecture/adr/ADR-0030-service-consolidation-30-targets.md)
and the per-service status lives in
[`docs/architecture/service-consolidation-map.md`](docs/architecture/service-consolidation-map.md).

## Cross-cutting invariants

These contracts are pinned by tests in `libs/core-models/**/*_test.go`
and must not drift:

- `/healthz` payload shape (`status`, `service`, `version`, `timestamp`).
- JWT claims field names + JSON tags
  ([`libs/auth-middleware/claims.go`](libs/auth-middleware/claims.go)).
- Resource RID format
  (`ri.<service>.<instance>.<type>.<uuid>` for platform-minted resources;
  [`libs/core-models/rid`](libs/core-models/rid) is the shared parser and
  registry-reserving minter).
- Resource type registry
  ([`libs/core-models/resource`](libs/core-models/resource) owns display names,
  owning services, icons, actions, RID namespace mapping, open-app URLs, and
  unknown-type placeholders).
- Compass project resource
  ([`services/tenancy-organizations-service`](services/tenancy-organizations-service)
  owns project RIDs, parent Space RIDs, organization/marking RIDs, default queue
  assignment, resource-level grant toggles, and per-role policies).
- Compass folder resource
  ([`services/tenancy-organizations-service`](services/tenancy-organizations-service)
  owns folder RIDs, project/parent/space RID projection, trash status, and
  folder-scope grant overrides on top of project policy inheritance).
- Compass move/rename
  ([`services/tenancy-organizations-service/internal/workspace`](services/tenancy-organizations-service/internal/workspace)
  updates parentage, names, slugs, and derived breadcrumbs while preserving
  project/folder RIDs; cross-project folder moves require policy/marking
  confirmations).
- Compass search index
  ([`services/tenancy-organizations-service/internal/workspace`](services/tenancy-organizations-service/internal/workspace)
  projects project/folder resources into `compass_resource_search_index`,
  stores long-text catalog bodies/source metadata for descriptions, READMEs,
  ontology object/property descriptions, code repository READMEs, and dashboard
  descriptions, and emits `compass.resource.search.updated.v1` outbox events on
  lifecycle mutations so search backends can consume changes without
  resource-table polling).
- Compass search API
  ([`GET /api/v1/compass/search`](services/tenancy-organizations-service/internal/workspace)
  intersects all results with project visibility, accepts text/type/project/
  owner/marking/last-modified filters, returns long-text snippets and facets
  for type/project/owner/marking/last-modified buckets, and pages by opaque
  cursor ordered by score, last-modified time, and RID).
- Compass search UI shell
  ([`apps/web/src/routes/search/SearchPage.tsx`](apps/web/src/routes/search/SearchPage.tsx)
  preserves the Quicksearch-style global shell, combines ontology search with
  permission-aware Compass resource search, loads recents/favorites for
  jump-to mode, shows marking badges, highlighted snippets, and resource
  facets, and resolves resource "Open with" actions through the frontend
  resource type registry).
- Compass saved searches
  ([`compass_saved_searches`](services/tenancy-organizations-service/internal/repo/migrations/0022_cmp23_saved_searches.sql)
  stores per-user named search queries with tab, type, project, owner, marking,
  and last-modified filters; `/api/v1/workspace/saved-searches` exposes the
  profile-backed sidebar list).
- Compass open-with menu
  ([`apps/web/src/lib/components/workspace/OpenWithMenu.tsx`](apps/web/src/lib/components/workspace/OpenWithMenu.tsx)
  is the shared launcher for search results, project/folder list rows, and
  resource detail headers; URL templates are declared by resource type and
  resolve against RID/project RID context with an unknown-resource fallback).
- Compass breadcrumbs
  ([`apps/web/src/lib/components/workspace/ProjectBreadcrumb.tsx`](apps/web/src/lib/components/workspace/ProjectBreadcrumb.tsx)
  builds the standard project/folder path from current resource metadata,
  links every ancestor to its open location, and exposes copy-RID actions for
  project and folder crumbs).
- Compass trash workflow
  (`services/tenancy-organizations-service/internal/workspace` soft-deletes
  project, folder, and resource-binding rows with `trash_retention_days` and
  `purge_after`; restore keeps the original placement when possible and
  returns a banner when a folder must be restored to the project root).
- Compass hard delete audit
  (`PurgeTrashed` only permanently deletes rows after `purge_after` unless the
  caller is an admin, removes directly affected Compass surface metadata, and
  emits `compass.resource.purged` through `audit.events.v1` with project
  markings and affected dependents).
- Compass resource audit
  (`libs/audit-trail` defines the standard `compass.resource.*` lifecycle
  events for create, move, rename, trash, restore, purge, share changes, and
  marking changes. Project/workspace handlers emit them in the same transaction
  as the resource mutation, and `audit-sink` serves them from the central audit
  query/export API).
- Compass bulk operations
  (`POST /api/v1/workspace/resources/batch` accepts selected search/folder rows
  for move, trash, and share; it performs all policy, marking, retention, and
  confirmation preflight checks before mutating any row and emits a single
  `compass.resource.bulk_operation` audit event with per-row outcomes).
- Compass reverse-reference graph
  (`compass_resource_references` stores directed source-depends-on-target
  edges; `GET|PUT /api/v1/workspace/resources/{kind}/{id}/references` exposes
  `depends_on` and `used_by`; the web resource details, move, and trash flows
  warn when upstream or downstream resources are present).
- Compass stable resource URLs
  (`apps/web/src/lib/compass/stableResourceUrls.ts` builds project/folder/app
  links from immutable RIDs, strips optional human-readable `--slug` suffixes
  before API calls, and keeps legacy UUID routes as compatibility aliases).
- Compass favorites
  (`user_favorites` and `user_favorite_groups` are the user-profile-backed
  resource shortcut store; `/api/v1/workspace/favorites` lists/adds/removes
  favorites and persists per-user group/order metadata consumed by `/favorites`
  and Quicksearch jump-to mode).
- Compass recents
  (`resource_access_log` is the per-user last-opened event stream; `/api/v1/workspace/recents`
  deduplicates by resource, caps responses at 50 by default, sorts by
  `last_accessed_at DESC`, and filters every row through current project
  visibility before Quicksearch or `/recent` can render it).
- Compass recommendations
  (`compass_project_follows` stores explicit per-user project follows;
  `/api/v1/workspace/recommendations` scores visible `compass_resource_search_index`
  rows from collaborator opens, the caller's recent opens, and followed
  projects, then Quicksearch jump-to mode renders the resulting "you might want
  to open" list).
- Compass propagate view requirements
  (`tenancy-organizations-service` treats the planned-deprecated Palantir
  setting as a legacy compatibility toggle. Project/folder rows store enabled
  state and the non-reenableable `disabled_at` marker; child folders and
  project resource bindings snapshot inherited view-requirement marking RIDs
  at create time. Parent policy changes enqueue
  `compass_view_requirement_propagation_jobs`, expose progress through the
  projects API, update existing descendants in the background, refresh folder
  search entries, and emit `compass.view_requirements.propagated` audit
  events).
- Dataset RID format `ri.foundry.main.dataset.<uuid-v7>`.
- Transaction state / type tokens (`open|committed|aborted`,
  `snapshot|append|update|delete`).
- Marking source discriminator
  (`{"kind": "direct"}` / `{"kind": "inherited_from_upstream", ...}`).
- Media reference camelCase keys
  (`mediaSetRid`, `mediaItemRid`, `branch`, `schema`).
- Schema field type discriminator
  (`{"type": "DECIMAL", "precision": ..., "scale": ...}`).
