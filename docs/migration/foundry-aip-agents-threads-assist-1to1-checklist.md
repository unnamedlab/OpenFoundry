# Foundry AIP Agents, Threads, and Assist 1:1 parity checklist

Date: 2026-05-13
Scope: public-docs-based parity plan for OpenFoundry's AIP agentic assistance
surfaces: AIP Agent Studio / AIP Chatbot Studio-style no-code agent files,
agent versions, instructions, model and temperature settings, retrieval context,
Ontology context, document context, citations, application state, action-taking
tools, object query tools, function tools, command tools, clarification tools,
agent sessions, streaming and blocking agent APIs, agents as Functions,
Workshop AIP Agent widget integration, OSDK and Developer Console handoffs,
AIP Threads ad-hoc conversations, document upload and document modes, thread
export, thread-to-agent upgrade, default agents, AIP Assist platform sidebar,
custom content source registration, custom source-backed Assist agents,
feedback, monitoring, usage, Marketplace packaging, branch/security handoffs,
and production-readiness guardrails for governed LLM assistants.

This document is intentionally implementation-oriented. It does not attempt to
clone Palantir branding, private source code, proprietary assets, screenshots,
or any non-public behavior. The target is **functional parity based on public
Palantir Foundry documentation**: the same product concepts, comparable agent,
thread, and assist workflows, compatible resource models where useful, and
OpenFoundry-native implementation details that can be tested locally.

## Parity scope boundary

All checklist work is governed by the
[Foundry public-docs parity policy](../reference/foundry-public-docs-parity-policy.md).
OpenFoundry may implement behavior described in public Palantir documentation,
but contributors must not copy private source, decompile bundles, import
tenant-specific exports, use Palantir branding, or reuse proprietary assets.
The product target is functional parity in an OpenFoundry-native implementation,
not a pixel-perfect clone.

This checklist covers agentic AIP surfaces that are **not** covered by the
[AIP Logic and Evals checklist](./foundry-aip-logic-evals-1to1-checklist.md):
interactive AIP Agents, AIP Threads, and AIP Assist. It should integrate with
AIP Logic/Evals for agents-as-Functions and evaluation suites; with the
Ontology/Object Views checklist for object, object set, action, interface, and
permission semantics; with Workshop for the AIP Agent widget and application
variables; with Developer Console/OSDK surfaces for external application
embedding; with Notepad, Media Sets, and Code Repositories for document/custom
content source ingestion; with DevOps/Marketplace for agent packaging; and with
Security/Governance for AIP enablement, model access, markings, audit, feedback,
retention, and safe logging. It should not duplicate those underlying services.

## Status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `todo` | Not implemented or not yet verified in OpenFoundry. |
| `partial` | Some surface exists, but behavior is incomplete or not wired end-to-end. |
| `blocked` | Requires a platform dependency, public documentation, or product decision. |
| `done` | Implemented, tested, documented, and verified through UI or API smoke tests. |

## Priority vocabulary

| Priority | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `P0` | Required for credible demo workflows that create, publish, chat with, and embed an agent using Ontology/document context and safe tools. |
| `P1` | Required for Foundry-style agent, thread, and Assist parity beyond simple chat completion. |
| `P2` | Advanced governance, marketplace, branching, observability, scale, external app, or enterprise rollout parity. |

## Official Palantir documentation library

These public docs should be treated as the external behavioral contract while
implementing this checklist.

## Milestone D: agent execution loop, persistent threads, tool permission boundary

> **Added 2026-05-17.** The earlier milestones cover the CRUD, app
> shells, retrieval, and packaging surfaces. This milestone tracks the
> **runtime semantics** that determine whether an agent really executes
> (ReAct-style loop), whether threads are truly replayable, and whether
> tools honor the caller's permissions on every invocation.

### Agent execution loop

- [ ] `AIPAG.41` Agent loop executor (`P0`, `todo`)
  - Server-side loop that, given an agent definition and an input, alternates LLM calls and tool invocations until a stop condition (final answer, max-step budget, human-approval gate, error).
  - Loop emits per-step events (`thought`, `tool_call_start`, `tool_call_end`, `assistant_partial`, `assistant_final`, `error`) to a stream consumable by SSE/WebSocket clients.
  - Required to make `agent-runtime-service` an actual runtime instead of a passive recorder of runs.
  - Docs: [Agent execution](https://palantir.com/docs/foundry/agent-studio/execution), [Agent loop](https://palantir.com/docs/foundry/agent-studio/loop).

- [ ] `AIPAG.42` Tool dispatcher with caller permission propagation (`P0`, `todo`)
  - Every tool invocation inside the loop carries the original caller's identity and clearances; the dispatcher resolves the tool's contract (`execute_function`, `apply_action`, `query_objects`, `update_app_variable`, `command`) and enforces permission checks at the tool's natural boundary (Functions runtime, Action engine, Object Storage V2 query layer).
  - The agent never gains elevated permissions; failed tool calls become structured error events the loop can react to.
  - Docs: [Tools](https://palantir.com/docs/foundry/agent-studio/tools).

- [ ] `AIPAG.43` Step budget and tool-call rate limits (`P1`, `todo`)
  - Per-agent max-step budget and per-invocation tool-call budget; exceeding either is a clean stop with a structured reason.
  - Per-tool rate limit declared in the AIP Console policy (see [AIP Logic/Evals milestone D](./foundry-aip-logic-evals-1to1-checklist.md#milestone-d-aip-console-and-aip-now-distribution)).
  - Docs: [Agent execution](https://palantir.com/docs/foundry/agent-studio/execution).

- [ ] `AIPAG.44` Human-approval gates (`P1`, `todo`)
  - Tools or final answers may declare `requires_human_approval: true`; the loop pauses, records a pending approval, and surfaces it to the operator UI; resume on decision.
  - Approvals audited with decider identity and rationale.
  - Docs: [Human approval](https://palantir.com/docs/foundry/agent-studio/human-approval).

### Persistent and replayable threads

- [ ] `AIPAG.45` Thread message log (`P0`, `todo`)
  - Every message and every tool-call event in a thread is appended to an immutable per-thread log with sequence numbers; the thread's state at any prefix is reconstructable.
  - Required for true conversation resumption, audit, and evaluation replay.
  - Docs: [Threads](https://palantir.com/docs/foundry/threads/overview), [Thread persistence](https://palantir.com/docs/foundry/threads/persistence).

- [ ] `AIPAG.46` Thread resume across sessions (`P0`, `todo`)
  - Loading a thread restores the full message + tool-call log; new turns append to the log under the new caller's identity (subject to permission re-checks on any retained context).
  - Docs: [Threads](https://palantir.com/docs/foundry/threads/overview).

- [ ] `AIPAG.47` Replay-as-eval mode (`P1`, `todo`)
  - Replay a recorded thread against a new agent version or new model with the same inputs to produce a side-by-side comparison consumable by AIP Evals.
  - Replay enforces deterministic seeds where the model supports it.
  - Docs: [Replay for evals](https://palantir.com/docs/foundry/threads/replay).

- [ ] `AIPAG.48` Thread retention and redaction (`P2`, `todo`)
  - Per-organization retention policies on threads; auto-redact PII in retained turns when retention exceeds a threshold.
  - Hard-delete via Compass trash flow.
  - Docs: [Threads retention](https://palantir.com/docs/foundry/threads/retention).

### Observability

- [ ] `AIPAG.49` Per-loop trace (`P1`, `todo`)
  - Each loop emits a parent OTel span with child spans per LLM call and per tool call; latency, token counts, and cost recorded.
  - Trace consumable from the agent detail UI and from the central observability stack.
  - Docs: [Agent execution](https://palantir.com/docs/foundry/agent-studio/execution).

- [ ] `AIPAG.50` Per-tool failure analytics (`P1`, `todo`)
  - Aggregate failure rate, p95 latency, and rate-limit hits per tool per agent over rolling windows; surface in the agent metrics view.
  - Docs: [Agent execution](https://palantir.com/docs/foundry/agent-studio/execution).

## Acceptance criteria for first complete AIP Agents milestone

- A builder can create an AIP Agent in a project folder, configure model, temperature, instructions, conversation starters, retrieval context, application state, and at least one safe tool.
- The builder can save and publish immutable agent versions, view/run a published version, and inspect Monitoring/Usage/Feedback basics.
- A user can chat with the agent through an API and through a Workshop AIP Agent widget with mapped application variables.
- A user can create an AIP Thread, upload/select a document, ask questions with citations, export the thread, and upgrade a thread configuration into an agent draft.
- An admin/builder can register a custom Notepad or Markdown documentation source for Assist and serve it either through the default Assist experience or a source-backed Assist agent.
- Agents can be published as Functions and invoked from AIP Evals or Automate-compatible surfaces with session reset semantics.
- Retrieval, tool calls, action confirmations, exports, and feedback are audited and permission-aware.

## Test plan expectations

- Unit tests for agent resource validation, prompt compilation, model settings, version snapshots, retrieval context manifests, application state mapping, tool schema validation, and token budgeting.
- Unit tests for permission decisions over document chunks, object queries, actions, functions, content sources, and Assist source serving rules.
