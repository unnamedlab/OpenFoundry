# CLAUDE.md — OpenFoundry (Go monorepo)

Onboarding for AI agents. Humans should also read `README.md` and
`CONTRIBUTING.md`, but those contain Rust-era statements that no longer
match this repo (see Gotchas below). When the two disagree, **this file
wins.**

## What this repo is

Single Go module (`github.com/openfoundry/openfoundry-go`) plus a React
frontend. Originated as a port of a Rust workspace; the Rust side is gone
from this tree but its vocabulary still leaks into docs.

```
apps/web/        React 19 + Vite + TypeScript frontend
services/        41 Go microservices (one binary per dir, see template/)
libs/            32 shared Go packages (kernels, observability, auth, …)
proto/           Source-of-truth .proto files (Go code generated to libs/proto-gen/)
sdks/            Generated client SDKs (TS/Python/Java)
infra/           Helm charts, ArgoCD, Terraform, runbooks
docs/            VitePress docs site (capability-oriented)
docs/archive/    Historical migration logs — DO NOT READ unless asked
tools/           CLIs (of-cli, route-audit, lint helpers)
```

Per-service shape (uniform — copy from `services/template/`):

```
services/<svc>/
  cmd/<svc>/main.go         entrypoint
  internal/server/          chi router wiring (/healthz /metrics /api)
  internal/handlers/        HTTP handlers
  internal/domain/          pure logic
  internal/repo/            data access (sqlc-generated when relevant)
  internal/repo/migrations/ goose-style SQL migrations
  internal/models/          wire types
  internal/config/          koanf-backed config
```

## Canonical commands

Run from repo root. The Makefile is authoritative. Ignore `justfile`.

```sh
make tools             # one-off: install buf, golangci-lint, sqlc, gofumpt to ./bin
make ci                # tidy + vet + lint + test  (the gate to pass before pushing)
make test              # unit tests, -race + coverage, fast (no Docker)
make test-integration  # integration (testcontainers, NEEDS DOCKER)
make gen               # regen proto Go + sqlc (run after touching proto/ or *.sql)
make build-services    # one binary per service into ./bin/
```

Frontend (`apps/web/`):

```sh
pnpm --filter @open-foundry/web dev    # vite dev server
pnpm --filter @open-foundry/web check  # tsc -b --noEmit
pnpm --filter @open-foundry/web test   # vitest
```

## Gotchas (real, not theoretical)

- **`justfile` is Rust-era.** It runs `cargo` against a workspace that no
  longer exists in this tree. Never invoke `just <target>`. Use `make`.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md` is stale**: says "~85 Rust microservices", "Cargo +
  pnpm + buf monorepo", and "Run `just lint test`". Treat it as
  out-of-date for stack/commands; the PR-process and RFC sections are
  still relevant.
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md` claims `apps/web (SvelteKit)` and "95 service
  directories"**. Actual: React 19 + Vite, 41 service directories. The
  service count overload is because the doc counts logical "ownership
  boundaries" — read with skepticism.
- **`.golangci.yml` is referenced by `README.md` but is not committed.**
  `make lint` will need either that file added or the lint config
  reconstituted before it passes.
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml` is the Rust CI (cargo).** The Go CI is
  `openfoundry-go.yml`. If you need to debug CI for this code, look at
  the latter.
- **Single Go module, root `go.mod`.** Don't create per-service modules.
- **`libs/proto-gen/` is generated.** Don't edit by hand — re-run `make gen`.

## Conventions

- **Errors:** `errors.Is`-style sentinels at package scope (`ErrNotFound`,
  `ErrPreconditionFailed`, …). HTTP layer maps them.
- **Wire types:** generic envelopes `models.Page[T]` and
  `models.ListResponse[T]`. Cursor-pagination uses `next_cursor`.
- **Auth:** every protected route goes through `libs/auth-middleware`.
  Claims live in `r.Context()` — fetch via the lib helpers, never parse
  JWT in handlers.
- **Observability:** use `libs/observability` for slog logger + OTel +
  Prometheus. Each service exposes `/metrics`; do not re-register globals.
- **Testing:** unit tests next to source as `*_test.go`. Anything needing
  Postgres/Cassandra/Kafka must use the `integration` build tag and the
  helpers in `libs/testing` (testcontainers).
- **DI:** state is held on a struct (`*Handlers`, `*AppState`). Avoid
  package-level globals; only 3 `init()` functions exist in the entire
  service tree — keep it that way.

## Security-critical zones

Changes here need extra care and explicit human review:

- `services/identity-federation-service/` — OIDC, SAML, MFA, WebAuthn,
  SCIM, JWKS rotation, Cedar admin policies.
- `services/authorization-policy-service/` — Cedar engine, ABAC/RBAC
  evaluation, restricted views.
- `libs/auth-middleware/` — JWT validation chain.
- `services/*/internal/repo/migrations/` — destructive DDL once shipped.
- `proto/auth/`, `proto/audit/` — wire-format breakage hits every
  consumer.

When touching these, surface the change in the PR description and
prefer additive changes over rewrites.

## What NOT to read

These exist for human historical context only. Loading them into your
context window wastes tokens and may give you obsolete instructions:

- `docs/archive/**` — Rust→Go migration logs, nightly summaries, phase
  inventories. Superseded by the live code.
- Root-level large MDs from the migration era:
  `HTTP-ROUTE-AUDIT.md` (108 KB), `AUDIT-RESPONSE-AND-FLOW-ENGINE-DESIGN.md`
  (97 KB), `ONTOLOGY-EVALUATION.md` (62 KB), `STUB-AUDIT.md`,
  `MIGRATION-*` and `ONTOLOGY-KERNEL-MIGRATION.md`,
  `microservicios-derivados-desde-foundry-docs.md`,
  `guia-migracion-services-a-microservicios.md`, `checklist.md`. They
  may still be referenced from ADRs; only read the cited section.
- `docs_original_palantir_foundry/` — third-party reference material,
  not OpenFoundry's own docs.

For runtime architecture, prefer:

1. `docs/architecture/index.md`
2. `docs/architecture/adr/` (decisions; numbered, dated, supersession-tracked)
3. The per-module `CLAUDE.md` in the directory you're editing

## Adding a new service

Copy `services/template/`, register it in:

- `infra/helm/apps/<chart>/` if it ships in a release
- `services/edge-gateway-service/internal/proxy/router_table.go` if it
  receives external HTTP traffic
- `infra/argocd/apps/` for GitOps deploy
