//! `AutomationRun` aggregate — pure state machine for the
//! Foundry-pattern replacement of the Temporal
//! `WorkflowAutomationRun` workflow.
//!
//! This module is the Tarea 5.2 deliverable of the migration plan
//! (`docs/architecture/migration-plan-foundry-pattern-orchestration.md`):
//! the state enum, the allowed-transition table, and the
//! `state_machine::StateMachine` implementation that backs the
//! `workflow_automation.automation_runs` table created by
//! `migrations/20260504100000_automation_runs.sql`.
//!
//! **Scope of this file**: pure, no-IO, no consumer / dispatcher
//! wiring. Tarea 5.3 wires the condition consumer + effect
//! dispatcher and instantiates `state_machine::PgStore<AutomationRun>`.
//! Keeping the state machine pure here lets the trait impl be unit
//! tested without a database and lets the persistence boilerplate
//! live entirely inside `libs/state-machine`.
//!
//! ## State table
//!
//! Allowed transitions (also enforced server-side by the SQL
//! `CHECK` constraint plus the application-level
//! `AutomationRunState::can_transition_to` guard):
//!
//! ```text
//!   Queued       → Running       (consumer claims)
//!   Queued       → Failed        (definition broken / pre-flight reject)
//!   Running      → Completed     (effect succeeded)
//!   Running      → Failed        (effect failed terminally)
//!   Running      → Suspended     (multi-step waits on external signal)
//!   Running      → Compensating  (saga rollback triggered)
//!   Suspended    → Running       (resumed by signal)
//!   Suspended    → Failed        (timeout sweep / external cancel)
//!   Compensating → Failed        (compensation finished — terminal)
//!   <terminal>   → <self>        (idempotent re-application — safe)
//! ```
//!
//! `Completed`, `Failed` are terminal; `Compensating` is bound for
//! `Failed`; `Suspended` is the only re-enterable non-terminal state.
