# ADR-0040 — Virtual tables service

**Status:** Historical draft; superseded by the current Go inventory where `virtual-table-service` is a gateway legacy alias owned by `connector-management-service`
**Date:** 2026-05-04

## Context

Foundry exposes virtual tables as "pointers to tables in supported data
platforms outside Foundry" — the platform queries the source on demand
rather than syncing data into a Foundry dataset. The published
behaviour is documented in
`docs_original_palantir_foundry/foundry-docs/Data connectivity & integration/Core concepts/Virtual tables.md`,
which prescribes:

* a per-source **virtual tables tab** in the Data Connection app,
* a published **compatibility matrix** for seven providers and ten
  table types,
* support for five **Iceberg catalogs** (AWS Glue, Horizon, Object
  Storage, Polaris, Unity),
* hard limits — agent-worker sources, agent-proxy / bucket-endpoint /
  self-service private-link egress policies are **not** supported,
* a **schema details panel** with Incremental / Versioning toggles,
* an **update-detection poller** that triggers downstream builds when
  a source row has changed.

D1.1.9 P1 wired the persistence + a server skeleton with first-class
endpoints, and P2 added the Foundry-worker / egress enforcement plus
the Iceberg catalog trait + matrix. P3 lands the UI tab + global
list/detail routes + Cedar policy stub. This ADR captures the
load-bearing decisions taken across P1 → P3 so future contributors
can tell what is "doc-aligned by design" vs "implementation choice".

## Decisions

### D-1: Historical dedicated `virtual-table-service` decision (superseded)

**Historical decision.** The original draft proposed a separate
`services/virtual-table-service` binary. That directory does **not** exist
in the current Go repository; `virtual_table_service_url` is a gateway
legacy alias whose current owner is `connector-management-service` (see
`docs/architecture/services-and-ports.md`).

**Why.**

* The data model is materially different — `virtual_tables`
  rows reference but do not own the source row, and the unique index
  spans `(source_rid, locator)` (not `(source_id, table_name)`). Co-
  locating the table inside `connector-management-service` would
  conflate two bounded contexts.
* The Foundry doc treats virtual tables as a separate **resource type**
  with its own RID prefix (`ri.foundry.main.virtual-table.<uuid>`)
  and its own audit stream — splitting the service mirrors that.
* The Iceberg catalog dependencies (potentially `aws-sdk-glue`,
  `iceberg-rest`, `databricks-sql`) would inflate the
  `connector-management-service` binary even when the operator is not
  using virtual tables. Feature flags isolate the cost in a dedicated
  crate.

**Historical trade-off.** The separate-binary trade-off below is retained
for audit context only. The current implementation avoids the second pod by
serving virtual-table routes from `connector-management-service`, while the
gateway keeps `virtual_table_service_url` as a legacy alias for Helm parity.

### D-2: Capability matrix is the single source of truth

**Decision.** The provider × table-type compatibility matrix lives in
`services/connector-management-service/internal/adapters/capabilities.go`, `services/connector-management-service/internal/domain/update_detection.go`, and the SDK validation surface. Every
register call reads its capabilities from this table; the UI mirrors
the same matrix in TypeScript so previews are doc-aligned.

**Why.** The Foundry doc explicitly publishes the matrix, and silent
drift between the doc and the registered row would mean a Foundry
user sees the wrong "Write" badge in Pipeline Builder. The
integration test `capability_matrix_matches_doc.rs` asserts every
cell verbatim — a doc revision that flips a cell breaks CI until
the matrix is updated to match.

**Alternative considered.** Reading capabilities from the connector at
register time (e.g. introspect Snowflake `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` to find
the right slot). Rejected because the doc-blessed capability — not
the actual SQL endpoint — drives Foundry's downstream features
(Pipeline Builder, Code Repositories pushdown, Contour). The matrix
is the contract; live introspection only fills in the schema.

### D-3: Iceberg catalogs behind a trait + per-kind module

**Decision.** `domain/iceberg_catalogs/mod.rs` defines the
`IcebergCatalog` trait and a closed `compatibility(provider,
catalog) → CompatibilityStatus` function. Each of the five published
catalog kinds is its own module with config validation + a
deterministic stub body; live SDK calls land behind the
`provider-iceberg` cargo feature in P2.next.

**Why.** The Foundry doc lists each catalog as a separate row of the
"Iceberg catalogs" matrix, with cells that go beyond GA / N/A
(`Legacy: recommended to use Databricks source` for S3 + Unity and
ABFS + Unity). Encoding the matrix as a function with a typed status
enum means Cedar policies + the UI can branch on `Legacy` without
duplicating the table.

### D-4: Egress policy enforcement at the registration boundary

**Decision.** Before any `register_virtual_table` write, the service
calls `connector-management-service` to fetch the source's
`worker_kind` + `egress.kind` and applies the doc § "Limitations"
rules. Failures return a structured **412 PRECONDITION FAILED** with
a stable error code so the UI can route the user to the right
remediation step.

**Why.** The doc lists five hard "not supported" rules. Without
enforcement at the registration boundary, the UI would silently
register tables that downstream Pipeline Builder / Code Repositories
runs would then reject for opaque reasons. Surfacing the error at
register time + bumping
`virtual_table_source_validation_failures_total{reason}` makes
mis-configured sources alert-able.

**Strict mode** is on by default
(`AppConfig::strict_source_validation = true`) and disabled in
integration tests that bypass the upstream service.

### D-5: Cedar entity carries the capability slice

**Decision.** The `VirtualTable` Cedar entity carries the
`capabilities` struct (read / write / incremental / versioning)
verbatim, alongside `markings`, `provider`, `project_rid` and
`source_rid`.

**Why.** Cedar evaluates in-process per ADR-0027; carrying the
capability slice on the entity means a policy can gate
`virtual_table::write_data` on `resource.capabilities.write == true`
without a round-trip to the capability-matrix lookup. Markings are
inherited from the source as a clearance floor — the policy
evaluates `resource.markings ⊆ principal.allowed_markings` exactly
as for a Foundry dataset, so a virtual table never grants more
clearance than the source it points to.

**Action vocabulary** (cedar_schema.cedarschema):

* `virtual_table::view` — required for `GET /virtual-tables/{rid}`
* `virtual_table::register` — required for the `register` endpoint
* `virtual_table::delete` — required for `DELETE /virtual-tables/{rid}`
* `virtual_table::write_data` — required for transforms that write
  back into the source (External Delta / Managed Iceberg / BigQuery
  / Snowflake / object stores per the matrix)
* `virtual_table::manage_markings` — required for the `PATCH
  /markings` endpoint
* `virtual_table::import_to_project` — required when copying a
  virtual table from its auto-registration project into another
  Foundry project

## Consequences

* The matrix lives in connector capability metadata, TypeScript
  `defaultCapabilities`, and SDK validation tests. Drift is loud — the
  tests fail, the type signatures diverge, and CI breaks. Worth the
  duplication for a contract this load-bearing.
* P2.next (live SDK integrations) is gated behind `provider-databricks`
  and `provider-iceberg` cargo features. CI runs the default profile so
  the service compiles and tests run on a developer laptop without
  AWS / Databricks / Snowflake credentials.
* Update detection (P5) and auto-registration (P4) are wired as
  no-op spawns in `main.rs`. Filling them in is a body-swap, not an
  architecture change.

## Decisions (cumulative)

* **D-1: Historical dedicated `virtual-table-service` draft** — superseded; the current repository has no such binary, and the gateway legacy alias resolves to `connector-management-service`.
* **D-2: Capability matrix is the single source of truth** — Go connector capability metadata + SDK validation tests triangulate against the published Foundry table.
* **D-3: Iceberg catalogs behind a trait + per-kind module** — five
  doc-listed catalog kinds, `compatibility(provider, catalog)` is
  closed and fails closed for combinations the doc does not bless.
* **D-4: Egress policy enforcement at the registration boundary** —
  Foundry-worker / direct egress / no agent proxy / no bucket
  endpoint / no self-service private link enforced via 412 with a
  stable error code so the UI surfaces the remediation hint.
* **D-5: Cedar entity carries the capability slice** — `VirtualTable`
  exposes `capabilities.{read, write, incremental, versioning}` so
  policies gate `virtual_table::write_data` without a network hop.
* **D-6: Auto-registration project is read-only** —
  `tenancy-organizations-service` provisions the managed project; the
  service-principal owns writes; users cannot manually edit resources
  in the project.
* **D-7: Orphaned tables are never auto-deleted** — doc § "Auto-
  registration" is explicit. The scanner marks
  `virtual_tables.properties.orphaned = true` and reads return
  `410 GONE_AT_SOURCE`.
* **D-8: Update detection falls back to "potential update" when
  versioning is not supported** — doc § "Update detection for virtual
  table inputs" is explicit. Object-store raw formats (Parquet, Avro,
  CSV plain) return `Version::Unknown` which the classifier maps to
  `PollOutcome::PotentialUpdate` so downstream triggers fire on every
  tick.
* **D-9: `@use_external_systems` decorator is build-blocked** — doc §
  "Limitations" prohibits the combination with virtual tables. The
  Python SDK validator emits
  `VIRTUAL_TABLE_USE_EXTERNAL_SYSTEMS_INCOMPAT`; the Go
  `pipeline-build-service` validator returns the same code so the build
  surface is uniform across CR + author.
