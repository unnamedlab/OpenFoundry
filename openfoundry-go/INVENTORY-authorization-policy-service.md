# Inventory — authorization-policy-service

## DECISION (2026-05-06): Option A — adopt `github.com/cedar-policy/cedar-go`

User signed off on **Option A** (cedar-go) over the sidecar (B) and the
"wait" stance (C). Rationale captured in conversation:

- The Rust binary `src/main.rs` is `fn main() {}` — there is no live
  production system to preserve byte-identical evaluation with. The
  conformance contract becomes "Cedar spec ↔ Go impl" (AWS's problem),
  not "Rust impl ↔ Go impl" (ours). This collapses the argument for the
  sidecar.
- AWS maintains cedar-rust and cedar-go in lock-step with the same
  conformance test suite; pre-1.0 risk is bounded (API drift, not
  unsoundness) and can be managed by pinning a tag and mirroring AWS's
  conformance tests in CI.

### De-risking step before the full service port

Before porting `authorization-policy-service` itself (~5 200 LOC), port
`libs/authz-cedar` → `libs/authz-cedar-go` first (1 671 LOC of glue +
cedar-go wrappers). That validates cedar-go in a bounded scope and ships
a reusable lib. Only after `libs/authz-cedar-go` passes its conformance
suite do we start porting handlers/domain in slices.

### Open question (non-blocking)

The Rust binary's `fn main() {}` may be intentional (project on hold) or
a TODO (consolidated binary pending). The Go port can proceed
independently of that answer — if the Rust binary stays a stub, the Go
port becomes the canonical implementation. Worth confirming
post-implementation but does not gate the work.

---

## Background — why this was a STOP-and-ask gate

This service was flagged in the migration prompt as a **STOP-and-ask
candidate** for two independent reasons:

1. **Cedar dependency.** Service depends on the `authz-cedar` workspace
   lib (1671 LOC of Rust glue around `cedar-policy = "4"`). Cedar is a
   policy engine with formal semantics; reimplementing it in Go from
   scratch is a multi-month effort. The viable paths require a project
   decision.
2. **Rust binary is currently a stub.** `src/main.rs` is literally:

   ```rust
   fn main() {}
   ```

   with all five S8/B14 sub-modules (`audit_wiring`, `checkpoints_purpose`,
   `cipher`, `network_boundary`, `security_governance`) included as
   `#[allow(dead_code)] mod …` "until the consolidated binary's main is
   wired in a follow-up". There is no live HTTP surface to compare
   against and no production callers exercising any handler today.

Combined: this is the highest-risk port in Phase 3. **Do not start the
port until a human signs off on the Cedar strategy.**

## Service shape

Total Rust source: **~5 203 LOC** across the consolidated crate.

| Subsystem (S8/B14 absorbed) | LOC ~ | Purpose                          |
|------------------------------|-------|----------------------------------|
| Top-level (handlers/, domain/, models/) | 1 800 | Roles, groups, policies, permissions, restricted views, ABAC evaluator |
| `security_governance/`        | 800   | Slice 6 — security posture, governance reviews |
| `checkpoints_purpose/`        | 700   | Slice 6 — purpose-of-use checkpoints |
| `cipher/`                     | 800   | Slice 6 — envelope encryption keys, key catalogs |
| `network_boundary/`           | 600   | Slice 6 — egress allowlists, residency boundaries |
| `audit_wiring.rs`             | 100   | Cross-cutting audit emission |

The four sub-modules (security_governance, checkpoints_purpose, cipher,
network_boundary) were absorbed from former standalone crates per
ADR-0030 (B14). They share the consolidated binary but ship independent
config + handlers + models — porting them as discrete slices is feasible.

### Handler surface (top-level)

| File                              | LOC | Surface area                             |
|-----------------------------------|-----|------------------------------------------|
| `handlers/role_mgmt.rs`           | 276 | Role CRUD, role/permission grants        |
| `handlers/permission_mgmt.rs`     |  69 | Permission catalog                        |
| `handlers/group_mgmt.rs`          | 286 | Group CRUD, membership, group→role grants |
| `handlers/policy_mgmt.rs`         | 183 | Cedar policy CRUD + reload                |
| `handlers/restricted_views.rs`    | 226 | CBAC restricted views (alternative implementation; see slice-7a in identity-federation) |
| `domain/rbac.rs`                  |  97 | RBAC evaluator                           |
| `domain/abac.rs`                  | 383 | ABAC + Cedar evaluator (depends on authz-cedar) |
| `domain/access.rs`                |  55 | Top-level access decision composer       |

## Cedar-go viability research

### Option A — adopt `github.com/cedar-policy/cedar-go` (recommended IF maturity acceptable)

cedar-go is the **official AWS-maintained Go port** of the Cedar policy
engine, mirroring the Rust `cedar-policy` crate's surface:

| Rust API surface (used by authz-cedar engine.rs)        | Go counterpart                              | Status |
|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------|
| `cedar_policy::PolicySet` + `is_authorized(req, ents)`  | `cedar.PolicySet` + `cedar.IsAuthorized(...)` | ✅     |
| `Request::new(principal, action, resource, ctx, schema)` | `cedar.NewRequest(...)`                     | ✅     |
| `Decision::Allow / Decision::Deny`                       | `cedar.Allow / cedar.Deny`                  | ✅     |
| `Response.diagnostics().reason()` (matched policy ids)   | `Response.Diagnostics().Reasons`            | ✅     |
| `Response.diagnostics().errors()`                        | `Response.Diagnostics().ErrorList`          | ✅     |
| `Entities` (entity store)                                | `cedar.EntityStore`                         | ✅     |
| Schema validation                                        | `cedar.NewSchema(...)`                      | ✅     |
| Policy text → AST parsing                                | `cedar.NewPolicySet(...)`                   | ✅     |

Risks:
1. cedar-go is **pre-1.0** as of writing. API may drift; pin a specific
   tag and review the changelog before bumping.
2. Cedar policy semantics are formally specified — both Rust and Go
   ports MUST agree on `Decision` for any policy/request pair. AWS
   maintains a conformance test suite that cedar-go runs in CI; we
   should mirror those tests in `libs/authz-cedar-go` as a regression
   guard.
3. cedar-go is sync-only (no async). Fine; Go's net/http handlers are
   synchronous anyway. Audit emission can be moved off-path with a
   buffered chan (matching the Rust `tokio::spawn` pattern).

### Option B — Cedar sidecar over gRPC

Run a small Rust binary embedding cedar-policy as a sidecar; expose a
gRPC `Authorize(req) → Decision` RPC. Go service calls it on the loopback.

Pros: zero risk on policy evaluation correctness — same code path as today.
Cons: extra deployment complexity (one more process per pod), latency
budget (sidecar IPC adds 0.2–1 ms per request — likely fine), ownership
overhead (we now maintain a second binary in two languages).

### Option C — Wait

Stay on Rust for authorization-policy-service indefinitely; let the
Phase 6 retire-Rust step revisit. This is the lowest-risk option but
contradicts the "1:1 Rust→Go migration" project goal.

### Recommendation

**Option A (cedar-go)** is the right path *if* the project is willing to
add a conformance-test commitment. Concretely:

- Port `libs/authz-cedar` to Go as `libs/authz-cedar-go` first (1 671 LOC,
  most of which is glue: PolicyStore, audit sink, Postgres reload, Kafka
  reload, NATS reload, iceberg-policies adapter, schedule policies).
- Mirror the upstream cedar-rust ↔ cedar-go conformance tests so any
  policy that authorizes Allow on Rust also authorizes Allow on Go.
- Only after the lib passes its conformance suite, port the
  authorization-policy-service binary itself (in slices: top-level
  RBAC/groups/policies → security_governance → checkpoints_purpose →
  cipher → network_boundary).

**Option B (sidecar)** is the right path *if* the team wants to ship Go
faster and is OK with a polyglot deployment. The Rust sidecar is a
50-LOC tonic gRPC server wrapping authz-cedar.

This decision is **out of scope** for the autonomous loop. Surfaces a
pending todo: "Pick Cedar strategy (A/B/C) for authorization-policy-service".

## Wire-format invariants (when port resumes)

Will need to be locked when implementation starts:
- Cedar policy IDs (UUIDs) preserved across the wire so audit logs match.
- `AuthzAuditEvent` JSON shape (timestamp, principal, action, resource,
  decision, tenant, policy_ids, diagnostics) must match the Rust struct
  byte-for-byte — currently emitted to Kafka via `audit-trail`.
- RBAC role + permission slugs (existing convention from
  identity-federation slice 6 — already locked).
- Cedar entity URID format: `Type::"value"` exactly as the Rust impl
  serializes.

## Sliced port plan (post-decision)

Once Cedar strategy is signed off:

1. **Lib** — `libs/authz-cedar-go` (1 671 LOC of glue + cedar-go wrappers).
2. **Top-level RBAC** — roles, groups, permissions, group→role grants (~700 LOC).
3. **Cedar policies** — policy CRUD + reload (~200 LOC).
4. **ABAC evaluator** — domain/abac.rs (~400 LOC) — depends on cedar engine.
5. **Restricted views** (alternative; coordinate with identity-federation slice-7a).
6. **security_governance** sub-module (~800 LOC).
7. **checkpoints_purpose** sub-module (~700 LOC).
8. **cipher** sub-module (~800 LOC).
9. **network_boundary** sub-module (~600 LOC).
10. **HTTP wire-up** — replace `fn main() {}` stub with real router.

Each slice is independently committable. Total estimated effort:
~10 iterations of ~1500 LOC each, gated on cedar-go conformance tests
passing.

## Decisions for human review

1. **Cedar strategy**: Option A (cedar-go), Option B (sidecar), or Option C (wait)?
2. **Conformance commitment**: Are we OK adopting AWS's cedar
   conformance test suite as a CI gate?
3. **Slice priority**: Top-level RBAC first, or one of the absorbed
   sub-modules (security_governance has the most live wiring upstream)?
4. **`fn main() {}` semantics**: Is the Rust crate intentionally on hold,
   or is there a separate timeline for wiring its main? If on hold, the
   Go port could become the canonical implementation rather than a
   strangler-fig replacement.
