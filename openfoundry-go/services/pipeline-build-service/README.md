# `pipeline-build-service` (Go)

Build / execution side of Pipeline Builder. The Rust crate is the
largest in the workspace (≈36 KLOC of source + 86 integration tests
covering DAG resolution, branch lock acquisition, multi-output
atomicity, log streaming, Spark / Iceberg orchestration). This Go
port now includes the resolver domain and wires the critical
`CreateBuild` / `DryRunResolve` HTTP paths through injectable
JobSpec, dataset-versioning, lock and build-persistence ports while
the executor and external production adapters continue to migrate.

## Port status

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| Health (`/health`, `/healthz`) + Prometheus (`/metrics`) | ✅ |
| HTTP surface | 🟡 partial — Go exposes the current `/api/v1` compatibility surface plus health/metrics; `docs/migration/route-parity-audit.md` lists remaining Rust `/v1`, `/api/v1/data-integration`, and `/api/v1/pipeline` gaps route-by-route |
| `internal/models` (`Build`, `BuildState`, `AbortPolicy`, `Job`, `JobState`, `Pipeline*`, `PipelineRun`) | ✅ ported 1:1 with the Rust enums + JSON tags |
| `internal/domain/joblifecycle` (Job state machine + `IsValidTransition` + `TransitionJob` + audit-log insert) | ✅ ported 1:1 with the four Rust unit tests |
| `internal/domain/markings` (T3.4 marking propagation SQL + transaction wrapper) | ✅ ported 1:1; idempotency via `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` |
| Build resolution (`resolve_build`, branch lock acquisition, fan-out) | ⏳ pending — handler paths that need this still return 501 |
| Build executor (DAG runner, multi-output transactions) | ⏳ pending — execution/rerun/cancel paths still return 501 |
| Iceberg output client (ADR-0041) | ⏳ pending — config warning remains accurate; multi-table atomicity is not enforced without the catalog URL |
| SparkApplication / kube-rs CR submission (FASE 3 / Tarea 3.4) | 🟡 partially wired — Spark run submit/status helpers exist; remaining Rust pipeline Spark routes are tracked as missing in the route audit |
| SSE log streaming | 🟡 config-gated placeholder — `/jobs/{id}/logs/stream` emits an initial event and then depends on log runtime wiring |

The endpoint shape is no longer documented from memory: use
`openfoundry-go/docs/migration/route-parity-audit.md` as the source of
truth for route parity. Current productive gaps are a mix of missing
legacy Rust paths, explicit `501 Not Implemented` handlers, empty list
envelopes, and config-gated log/runtime behavior.
| Build resolution domain (`resolve_build`, input validation, branch lock acquisition, fan-out) | ✅ ported under `internal/domain/resolver` |
| HTTP build resolution (`POST /api/v1/builds`) | ✅ wired to resolver through injected ports; returns Rust-compatible `202 Accepted` / `400` resolution failures |
| Dry-run resolution (`POST /api/v1/dry-run/resolve`) | ✅ uses resolver load/cycle/branch-resolution steps without opening build records, output transactions or locks |
| Production repo adapters for JobSpec / dataset-versioning / build persistence | ⏳ pending — handlers return explicit `503` until ports are injected; no silent stubs |
| Build executor (DAG runner, multi-output transactions) | ⏳ pending |
| Iceberg output client (ADR-0041) | ⏳ pending |
| SparkApplication / kube-rs CR submission (FASE 3 / Tarea 3.4) | ✅ CR rendering/submission surface ported; returns 503 when kube client is unavailable |
| SSE log streaming | ✅ live history/follow stream wired via injected log service |

The endpoint shape is identical to the Rust crate so dashboards,
clients and the Spark CR template can talk to either binary. Resolver-backed
handlers no longer return `501`; remaining unported surfaces still respond
with `501 Not Implemented` carrying a machine-parseable detail field.
