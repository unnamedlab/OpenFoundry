# Ontology Actions Service Go Parity Inventory

Date: 2026-05-08

This is a manual parity audit for the 1:1 Rust → Go migration of `ontology-actions-service`. The automated route audit was first corrected and re-run so chi nested routes mounted with `r.Route("/api/v1/ontology", ...)` are compared as their effective `/api/v1/ontology/...` paths instead of false unprefixed paths.

## Sources inspected

- Rust router: `services/ontology-actions-service/src/lib.rs`.
- Go router: `openfoundry-go/services/ontology-actions-service/internal/server/server.go`.
- Go kernel handlers: `openfoundry-go/libs/ontology-kernel/handlers/actions`, `funnel`, `functions`, `rules`, plus `storage` for `/storage/insights`.
- Runtime wiring: `openfoundry-go/services/ontology-actions-service/cmd/ontology-actions-service/main.go`.
- Route audit command: `cd openfoundry-go && go run ./tools/route-audit -services ontology-actions-service`.

## Status vocabulary

- `implemented`: effective route exists and the state-backed Go kernel handler contains real behavior.
- `partial`: effective route exists and substantial behavior is present, but at least one Rust behavior is deferred or incomplete.
- `config-gated`: effective route exists but runtime behavior depends on optional service configuration such as `DATABASE_URL`, Python sidecar, or external service URLs.
- `missing`: Rust route has no effective Go route.

## Route audit result after nested-prefix fix

`tools/route-audit` now reports `Rust routes: 51. Go routes: 52. State counts: implemented: 52.` for `ontology-actions-service`. The extra Go route is `GET /healthz`. There are no Rust routes reported as missing after propagating `/api/v1/ontology` through chi nested router callbacks and router-parameter mount helper calls.

### 501 / empty-envelope / missing route inventory

| Class | Count after this pass | Routes | Verification |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `501` | 0 | none | `go run ./tools/route-audit -services ontology-actions-service` reports only `implemented: 52`; source audit under the allowed Go ontology-actions paths has no `http.StatusNotImplemented` handler. |
| `empty-envelope` | 0 | none | Route audit reports no empty-envelope statuses; handlers return concrete action/function/rule/funnel/storage envelopes rather than placeholder `{}`/empty-list responses. |
| `missing` | 0 | none | The 51 Rust routes are all present in Go; `GET /healthz` is the only extra Go route. |

> Note: the route-audit status is intentionally route-shape oriented. The inventory below is the source-of-truth for real behavioral status (`config-gated` distinctions such as Python sidecar wiring).

## Runtime wiring

| Concern | Rust | Go | Status | Data source / runtime | Associated tests |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Protected ontology surface | `Router::new().nest("/api/v1/ontology", protected).layer(auth_layer).with_state(state)` | `r.Route("/api/v1/ontology", func(api chi.Router) { api.Use(authmw.Middleware(jwt)); mount... })` | implemented | JWT middleware, HTTP router | Rust integration tests under `services/ontology-actions-service/tests`; Go `internal/server/server_test.go` |
| Public probes | `GET /health`, `GET /metrics` in `main.rs` | `GET /health`, `GET /healthz`, optional `GET /metrics` with action execution collectors registered into the service registry | implemented | in-process JSON health and Prometheus handler plus ontology action counters/histograms | Go `internal/server/server_test.go`, `libs/ontology-kernel/metrics` tests |
| State-backed handlers | Rust always receives `AppState` | Go now requires a non-nil `AppState` and always mounts ontology-kernel handlers; missing `DATABASE_URL` or Cassandra runtime store config fails startup unless explicit local/test mode is enabled | config-gated | PG via `DATABASE_URL`; Cassandra/Scylla via `CASSANDRA_CONTACT_POINTS` + `CASSANDRA_KEYSPACE`; explicit local/test in-memory state via `OF_DEV_STUB_MODE=true` | Go service tests create an explicit in-memory `AppState` |
| Store wiring | Rust kernel state | `buildState` requires `DATABASE_URL` by default, creates a PG pool, and `buildStores` wires Cassandra object/link/action/read-model stores plus PG definitions; in-memory stores are allowed only in explicit dev/test mode | implemented | PG + Cassandra/Scylla; optional Vespa/OpenSearch search backend | Go `cmd/ontology-actions-service/main_test.go`, `libs/cassandra-kernel` tests, kernel store tests |
| Python runtime | Rust inline Python path | Go executes inline Python through `libs/python-sidecar` when `PYTHON_SIDECAR_BINARY` is set; production rejects `PYTHON_PACKAGES_ENABLED=true` without it | config-gated | Python sidecar injected as `AppState.PythonRuntime` | Go `cmd/.../main_test.go`, actions/domain python sidecar integration tests |

## Writeback/outbox

| Area | Rust behavior | Go parity assessment | Status | Data source / runtime | Tests |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Object writeback | Apply object mutations and append revisions/outbox entries | Go `handlers/objects` delegates to `domain.ApplyObjectWithOutbox`; update_object, interface create/modify, and function object_patch effects call that canonical helper instead of handler-local ObjectStore fallbacks, while delete operations use the ObjectStore delete contract as in Rust | full for action object effects | PG outbox + configured object store; nil-PG path is limited to explicit dev/test AppState | Go `handlers/objects/objects_test.go`, actions execute tests |
| Action side-effects | Webhook writeback, webhook side-effects, notifications, batched execution | Go action side-effects include synchronous webhook writeback, success-only webhook fan-out, notification fan-out, structured audit POSTs, Prometheus/action-log attempt recording for success and all classified failure paths, and side-effect action-log rows | full for action operations | HTTP external, action log, optional notification/audit URLs | Go `handlers/actions/side_effects_test.go`, `execute_test.go` |
| Funnel run writeback | Dataset rows → object writes + revisions | `TriggerFunnelRun` executes source validation, optional pipeline trigger, dataset preview, row validation, object upsert/writeback, revision append, terminal run ledger, and source `last_run_at` update | full | PG/DefinitionStore source metadata, HTTP dataset/pipeline services, object store/writeback, action-log run ledger | Go `handlers/funnel/funnel_test.go` |
| Cassandra writeback/indexes | Rust deployment may rely on Cassandra-backed stores | Go production startup wires Cassandra/Scylla object/link/action/read-model stores when configured and explicit dev mode uses in-memory stores | implemented | Cassandra/Scylla in production; in-memory only for `OF_DEV_STUB_MODE=true` tests/dev | Go `cmd/.../main.go`; `libs/cassandra-kernel` tests |

## Conformance/tests

| Suite | Rust tests | Go tests | Current assessment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Route shape | `services/ontology-actions-service/src/lib.rs` plus integration tests under `services/ontology-actions-service/tests` | `go test ./tools/route-audit`; `go run ./tools/route-audit -services ontology-actions-service`; `internal/server/server_test.go` | No route-shape gaps after nested-prefix fix. |
| Actions | Rust action handler tests in the service/kernel source | `go test ./libs/ontology-kernel/handlers/actions/...` files: `actions_test.go`, `execute_test.go`, `batch_test.go`, `inline_edit_test.go`, `side_effects_test.go`, Python sidecar integration | Real kernel handlers are mounted; action validate/execute, execute-batch, inline-edit, observability, and best-effort side-effect behavior are complete for object/link/function/interface operation kinds. |
| Funnel/storage | Rust funnel/storage tests | `handlers/funnel/funnel_test.go`, `handlers/storage/storage_test.go`, storage handler/domain tests | Funnel CRUD/run/health and storage insights use real stores and have no remaining 501 gap. |
| Functions/media | Rust function package tests and `tests/functions_on_media.rs` | `handlers/functions/functions_test.go`, `internal/mediafunctions/media_test.go`, function runtime/domain metrics tests | Function CRUD/validate/run reads use persistent package/run records; simulation uses the Python sidecar for Python packages, records success/failure run history, exposes real run metrics, and now has service-level coverage that drives `POST /api/v1/ontology/functions/{id}/simulate` through `libs/python-sidecar.Manager` against a fake gRPC sidecar. Missing sidecar coverage asserts the `503` machine-readable `python_runtime_not_wired` envelope. |
| Rules/machinery | Rust rule/machinery tests | `domain/rules_test.go` and rules handler package tests | Rule catalog, machinery routes, and apply writeback use the DB-backed writeback substrate. |
| Service runtime | Rust binary/integration setup | `go test ./services/ontology-actions-service/...` | Tests create explicit in-memory `AppState`; production startup requires `DATABASE_URL` and optional sidecar/external URLs. The command-package service tests additionally start a fake sidecar binary via `libs/python-sidecar.Manager`, inject it through `AppState.PythonRuntime`, and verify the protected function simulation route executes real runtime plumbing rather than a route-shape stub. |

## Intentionally unsupported / config-gated operations

There are no intentionally unsupported ontology-actions-service HTTP routes for parity with Rust after this pass. The remaining non-`implemented` notes are operational gates, not placeholder handlers:

1. Cassandra/Scylla runtime stores are required for production startup; operators must provide `CASSANDRA_CONTACT_POINTS` and `CASSANDRA_KEYSPACE` and provision the keyspace replication policy.
2. Inline/function execution is guarded by `PYTHON_PACKAGES_ENABLED`: production startup requires `PYTHON_SIDECAR_BINARY` when Python packages are enabled, while explicit dev/test mode may omit it to preserve the Rust-compatible `python_runtime_not_wired` response.
3. `state == nil` is rejected by the Go router; local/test execution must create an explicit in-memory `AppState`.
